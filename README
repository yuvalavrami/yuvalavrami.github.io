# Favorite Star Wars

This project generates a website in which all first 6 films of the Star Wars' Skywalker saga are presented,
by wrapping the star wars API (swapi.dev), and allows the user to mark any of the films as favorites.
Favorites are saved between sessions using a cookies file.

# The project contains:
1. README file (this)
2. index.html
3. stylesheet.css
4.main.js

To open the web page:
go to: https://github.com/yuvalavrami/yuvalavrami.github.io

to open the web page locally, save all files in one folder and run 'index.html' using a browser.
Accessing the web page through a browser locally does not enable saving cookies, 
so the saved favorited functionality won't work that way. 
To solve this issue either (a) open the web page through the provided link (https://github.com/yuvalavrami/yuvalavrami.github.io)
or (b) open the files through a code editor (e.g websorm, vscode etc.) and access a browser throuh the code editor.
